Twyne
=====

A web based journal system for words and pictures.

This application operates in some ways similar to a blogging platform (it publishes your content),
but also as a way to read posts from other systems (such as Twitter, or blogs).

When you first log in, you can start posting content immediately,
and it will appear in your feed.
This is the right-hand column of the two main columns on the home page.
You can also add your contacts, and then you'll start seeing their news in the left-hand column.

Multiple people can use one installation.
